## 🧪 API Endpoints

| Route                              | Method | Purpose                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| `/api/v1/jobs`                     | POST   | Submit new job         |
| `/api/v1/jobs/:id`                 | GET    | Get job status         |
| `/api/v1/jobs/:id/cancel`          | DELETE | Cancel running job     |
| `/api/v1/queues`                   | GET    | List active queues     |
| `/api/v1/workers`                  | GET    | Worker status & health |
| `/api/v1/trace/:job_id`            | GET    | Job execution trace    |

## 📆 Database Schema (Simplified)

### Job

```ts
id | type | status | priority | submitted_by | created_at
```

### Queue

```ts
id | name | worker_count | max_parallel_jobs | current_load
```

### Worker

```ts
id | queue_id | status | current_job_id | last_heartbeat
```
